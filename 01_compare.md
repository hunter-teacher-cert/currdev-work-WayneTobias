Microsoft TEALs (BJC) & Mobile Computer Science Principles

Major Differences:	BJC curriculum focuses on the creation of projects that utilize lists and is a follow up for their Intro curriculum.  The MCSP program has a mobile app focus.  BJC provides a curriculum that is mapped out for you and uses a minimum of file locations to simplify things.  MCSP has many resources that you need to coordinate

Major Similarities:	Both courses align with the majority of standards.  Both give you guidance for showing understanding of the material

Comparative Strength & Weaknesses: 	The BJC curriculum appears easier to follow along with at first glance.  The structure of the lab gives clear stop and start points, has material for “going further” and is student friendly.  The BJC curriculum uses Snap which is not an industry language.

Adopt:	I currently use BJC and there are several activities that are similar from the two resources.  I would easily adopt one or two of the labs from MCSP.  There are also good resources for use after the AP exam in late May.
